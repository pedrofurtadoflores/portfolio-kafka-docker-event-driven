# Portfolio Kafka, Docker and Microservices – Spring Boot

This is a portfolio project built with Java and Spring Boot, demonstrating microservices communication using Apache Kafka. The application simulates an order/payment workflow where the Order Service emits events to a Kafka topic and the Payment Service listens and responds accordingly.

The services are containerized with Docker and communicate asynchronously via Kafka, enabling a loosely coupled, scalable architecture. This project focuses on event-driven design, clean code structure, and message-based microservice interaction without HTTP dependencies.
